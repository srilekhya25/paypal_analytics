PayPal Transaction Analysis & Dashboard:

This project is a complete data analytics pipeline that demonstrates the process of generating, loading, analyzing, and visualizing transaction data. It includes Python scripts for data processing, SQL for analysis, and an interactive HTML dashboard for presenting the final insights.

Project Files
Here is a breakdown of all the files included in this project:

copy_of_paypal_data_generator_for_colab.py: A Python script to generate a large, realistic dataset of 1,000,000 PayPal transactions and save it as a .csv file.

paypal_transactions.csv: The raw transaction data generated by the Python script.

load_data_to_db.py: A Python script that reads the .csv file and loads all the data into a local SQLite database file (paypal_analytics.db).

analyze_data.py: A Python script that connects to the SQLite database and runs a series of analytical queries to extract key metrics and insights.

generate_dashboard.py: A Python script that creates a static visual dashboard from the data and saves it as a .png image.

paypal_analytics_dashboard.png: The static image of the dashboard generated by the generate_dashboard.py script.

dashboard.html: A fully interactive, self-contained dashboard that runs in any web browser. It uses an embedded dataset, so it works without any external files.

index.html: A more advanced dashboard template designed to be connected to a live database in a real-world application.

paypal_analytics_queries.sql: A reference file containing the SQL queries used for the analysis.

How to Run This Project (Step-by-Step)
Follow these steps to run the full data pipeline from start to finish.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed, along with the following libraries. You can install them from your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pandas faker matplotlib seaborn

Step 1: Generate the Raw Data
Run the data generation script to create the paypal_transactions.csv file.

python copy_of_paypal_data_generator_for_colab.py

Step 2: Load the Data into the Database
Next, run the script to load the data from the CSV file into the SQLite database. This will create a new file called paypal_analytics.db.

python load_data_to_db.py

Step 3: Run the Data Analysis
Execute the analysis script to run the SQL queries on your database. The results will be printed to your terminal.

python analyze_data.py

Step 4: Generate the Static Dashboard Image
Run this script to create the paypal_analytics_dashboard.png image file.

python generate_dashboard.py

Step 5: View the Interactive Dashboards
This is the final, visual part of the project. Simply open either of the following HTML files in your web browser to see the interactive charts:

dashboard.html: The simpler, single-file interactive dashboard.

index.html: The more advanced, production-ready dashboard.
